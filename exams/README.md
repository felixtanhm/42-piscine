Below are a few repositories that can be used to assist with your exam preparations:

- [42 Exam by JClutz](https://github.com/JCluzet/42_EXAM): A mock exam shell created by a 42 graduate. Great to familiarise yourself with an actual exam scenario. However, questions might be harder than what the SG campus administers, and solutions / mock moulinette might be outdated.
- [42 Exam by gcamerli](https://github.com/gcamerli/examshell): Another mock exam shell, with questions and levels closer to the difficulty levels of the SG campus.
- [42 Exam Questions](https://github.com/pasqualerossi/42-Piscine/tree/main/42%20Piscine%20Exam): A student from 42 Adelaide has documented a very comprehensive list of possible exam questions, sorted by level, with their solutions. ðŸ¤©
