# Piscine Tips
### **Week1:** Shell00, Shell01, C00, C01
- `C00` will be available on the 3rd day of the Piscine. Start work on it immediately as `Exam00`, the first exam, will be on the C language.
- If you have not finished `Shell01` by the 3rd day, skip it and work on it when you have spare time. Focus on `C00` and `C01`.
- **Do `Rush 00`**. You have to participate in at least one Rush during the Piscine to qualify for the program and the rest of the Rushes are very difficult.
### **Week2:** C02, C03, C04, C06
- Leave `C05` for Week 3. It's better to work on `C06` as the concepts in `C06`(argc and argv) are part of `Exam01`.
- If you managed to finish `C06` comfortably during the 2nd week, you can give `Rush01` a try. It's an interesting problem and a potential programming interview problem.
- Otherwise, it's perfectly fine to skip `Rush01` if you've already done `Rush00`.
### **Week3:** C05, C07, C08, C09
- If you did not participate in any other Rush, you have to do `Rush02`.
- It's fairly possible to finish this week's topics ahead of time, especially if you skipped `Rush01`. With your spare time, you can move ahead and try `C11`, or try to get 100% in previous Projects.
- Skip `C10`, as it's very difficult.
### **Week4:** C11
- Focus on `C11` and finishing the previous Projects with 100%.
- When you're done, you can try to do `C10`. Without finishing `C10`, `C12` and `C13` won't be available to you.
- Remember to allocate time to prepare for the final exam.

# Exam Tips
### **Exam Registration**
- You need to register for the Exam Event **BEFORE** the exam. Failure to do so will result in a default fail for the exam.
- During the exam, you have 10 minutes to log in to your `examshell`. Failure to do so will result in a default fail for the exam.
- To log in, type `exam` as the username and password, instead of your normal username and password.
- Open your Terminal, and type in `examshell`.
- Log in with your normal username and password.
### **Exam Topics**
- **Exam00**: Functions, Loops, Conditionals, Arrays and Strings
- **Exam01**: ArgC & ArgV and everything from Exam00
- **Exam02**: Malloc, Free and everything from Exam01
- **Exam03**: Headers, Libraries, Makefile, Function Pointers and everything from previous exams.
### **Taking the Exam**
- You do **not** need to `norminette` your exam solutions.
- You **do** need to pay attention to what the exam question is asking for. Remove any unnneccesary testing functions, libraries, and files.
- Before submission, commit and push your code to the `rendu/<test question>` directory.
- To submit, type `grademe` in the examshell and wait for your results.
- Upon each submission, there are `traces` that will be saved to your `traces` folder. These traces can help you debug what went wrong with your solution.
